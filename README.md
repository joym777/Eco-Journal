### Website Logic. 
Consisting of 3 main pages, Eco-Journal has it home page- where most of the website content is. this is where you, the user, sign in, record your actions and watch your progress. the vision page. This contains our purpose and our inspirations. from liveley souls such as Greta Thunberg, to our departed heroes such as Wangari Maathai. this page reminds us of how much we can do if we start now. Others. This page is yuor aid. Living in a time where almost everything has been designed in an environmentally unsustainable manner, some of your efforts could be translated to an environmental organization to help you make that change. On top of donations, visist websites that help you understand the impacts of climate cghange, and the impacts of your eco-friendly actions :D

##### How the website works:
- when the user signs in, their name and actions (if any are present) are stored in LocalSTorage so that the user's data is saved efficiently even after refreshing and/or closing the browser.
- Through that, the information is stored as an object containing: text, action category and date.
- The progress bar dynamically adjusts its filling based on how many actions have been completed by the user. in this case, 1 action=1% progress
- DOM manipulation and event handling play a key role in making this web application interactive and responsive 

## Technologies used:
- HTML5 for page structure and layout
- CSS3 for styling and design
- JavaScript(ES6) for interactive logic, DOM Manipulation and LocalStorage

## Future improvements.
- Have a calendar that displays your progress shwoing the number of actions completed daily
- Creating a leaderboard to encoruage riendlt eco-activity challenges among users.
