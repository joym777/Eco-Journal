      <h2>Our Vision.</h2>
      <p>Eco journal was created to help your sustainable growth- to remind us that what we do to the earth, we also do to ourselves.
        We often think change matters when its in a large scale, but truly, every action aiming for change matters just as much. 
        This space was built to ground us in the belief that change is much nearer than we make it out to be; change is in your home, your habits, and your actions.
        Create eco-friendly habits, be aware of your actions and yur impacts. Together, they from a wave of change!
